# ScreenLife

### Prerequisites
Sign in to your [Azure Storage account](https://portal.azure.com/) (i.e. screenlifepipelinetest1)

Install the [Azure CLI](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/cli/azure/install-azure-cli)

Python 3.8+
## Setting up
This section walks you through preparing a project to work with the Azure Blob Storage client library for Python.

Clone the github repo:

    git clone https://github.com/mediatization/ScreenLife

Swtch to the Azure directory:

    cd C:\github\ScreenLife\azure
    
    Powershell
    Set-Location -Path C:\github\ScreenLife\azure


Open the Python application file named [quickstart_blob.py](C:\github\ScreenLife\azure\blob_quickstart.py)

## Install the packages

From the 'Azure' directory, install packages for the Azure Blob Storage and Azure Identity client libraries using the pip install command. The azure-identity package is needed for passwordless connections to Azure services.

    pip install azure-storage-blob azure-identity

Sign-in to Azure through the Azure CLI using the following command:


    az login
 
Navigate to the directory containing the blob_quickstart.py file, then execute the following python command to run the app:

    python blob_quickstart.py

 The blob_quickstart.py file creates a test file in your local folder and uploads it to Azure Blob Storage. The example then lists the blobs in the container, and downloads the file with a new name. You can compare the old and new files.
